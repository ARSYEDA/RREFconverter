I got the idea of this process in my linear algebra class. Systems
of equations can be solved by putting the coefficients in an augmented
matrix. Row reducing a matrix makes it easier to solve. This process takes
a long amount of time to do by hand because of the amount of times
you have to rewrite the matrix for each step. I figured that this converter
could solve these problems faster than doing it by hand. 

This program also includes some test functions in the matrix.cpp file.
These are meant to verify that everything is working through each step. 

This is a project that I am working on for personal practice.
